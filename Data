Use Google Earth Engine or USGS Earth Explorer to downaload data.
I prefer GEE as data can be customized to specific needs.

For this project, I used Landsat 9 (therm + vis) and Sentinel 1 (microwave).
1. Location - Bhopal
2. Date- Feb, 2023

I used Lee speckle filter for Sentinel 1, it reduces preprocessing time greatly.
